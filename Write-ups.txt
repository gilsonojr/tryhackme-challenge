 **Solution Walkthrough**

1. **Recognizing the Encoding**
   - The first step in solving this challenge is identifying the encoding used for the hidden string. The presence of characters such as `#` and the structure of the string suggest that it's encoded in **Base64**.

2. **Decoding the String**
   - To decode the string, you can use a variety of online tools, such as [Base64 Decode](https://www.base64decode.org/), or a local command-line tool like `base64` on Linux or macOS.

   Here's the string to decode:
